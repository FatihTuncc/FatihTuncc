# 👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Fatih Tunc.

In 2016, I did an internship in Portugal about solar panels. In 2018, I started my engineering education at Sakarya University of Applied Sciences. During my education, I developed myself in the field of electronics and hardware design. I continue to improve myself in the field of embedded software and hardware design.
